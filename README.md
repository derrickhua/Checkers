# **Checkers** 

---

## Brief Description
Checkers is said to be an ancient game with many variants. There have been similar board games dating back to as early as 3000 BC. The variant I am choosing to use is American Checkers. It is played by two opponents. One player has black pieces and the other usually white or red. Players alternate turns and pieces can only move diagonally to a closeby square. If an opposing pieces occupies a diagonal space while the square across it is vacant, the piece may be captured. The player without any remaining pieces or is unable to move any pieces, loses the game. 

## Pieces

### Man 
This is a regular piece which only move one step diagonally forwards and has the ability to capture an adjacent enemy's piece as long as it can land on the next square. The Man will also be able to capture multiple times in a row as long as its going in the same direction.

### King
When a man reaches the farthest row forward, known as the kings row or crown head, it becomes a king.
For this version, the king will only have the bonus ability to capture and move backwards.

# Getting Started

## Link to the Game
[GAME HERE](https://derrickhua.github.io/Checkers/)

* Player 1/ BLK will always go first. 
* It's as simple as clicking on a piece and clicking on a space.
* To consume you must click on the enemy piece not the space behind it.
* To eat multiple pieces, click the first piece and then the subsequent piece. If you click your unit again, it will end your turn. 

# Next Steps 
* Create a king that can move multiple spaces diagonally
* Make better CSS/HTML animations for win screen
* Make an animation for capturing a piece. Maybe the score board could highlight itself
